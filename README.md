Northwind Traders Data Analysis Project 

For this project, I analyzed sales and order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier. I obtained this dataset from [Maven Analytic's Data Playground.](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets) 

The data represents July through December of 2013, all of 2014, and through May 6 of 2015. 

## Business Questions
1. How are sales going so far in 2015 as compared to the previous year?
2. Which categories bring in the most revenue?
3. Which products have the highest and lowest sales?
4. Are there any key customers? Has this changed over time? 

## Data Analysis Process
I downloaded the datasets and did some initial cleaning in Excel (changing header names, ensuring data types are correct and consistent, checking for missing values or nulls). Then, I uploaded the data to Tableau and created relationships in the data source pane. From here, I used only Tableau to analyze and visualize the data. I did occassionally open the data in Excel to QA my Tableau calculations or search for the data to find certain values or quickly answer a question-- this is much faster and easier to do in Excel.
